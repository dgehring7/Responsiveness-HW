This is supposed to be a responsive website that adjusts based on the screen. This is a project to improve and expand my coding skills.
I used a mixture of HTML and Bootstrap to work on this project. I know it's not finished, but is a work in progress. 
Ini the future itr should be a library of projects that show how I code.
